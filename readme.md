# Advent of Code 2021

i'm doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) in Haskell this year.

figured i'd publish solutions here.

there's a directory per day, each with subdirectories for rounds one and two.

projects are created with `stack new` and all the code is in `./app/Main.hs`.

on second thought, `stack` is probably overkill here, i'll probably try straight `ghc` for tomorrow. if i don't run into any package management/dependency issues, i'll probably stil with that.

## day 3

so ghc works fine. the solution for 3.2 was over-refactored and could probably be a lot more concise. but it does work properly.
